# ProjectSyllabusDB

The Project aims to present syllabus of all the courses, offered Delhi University, in a more interactive manner than pdfs.

At first, I made it for fun but then I realized since I rarely attend classes, it helps to catch up with the class in no time as now I know what all stuff I should be expecting and on top of that I don't need to scroll tens of pages of pdfs to find the syllabus of a course, it's just one click away now.

# What to do

I am gonna need couple of hands because this one's a big task, anyone who want to be a part of this project and contribute to it just hit me up on my mail @
keshavandteam@gmail.com and let me know which task you are taking up. You can also message me on discord (Id:- Professor#0785)

Following are the tasks that we need to do:

<h3> Collect data about the courses: </h3>

  Get the latest pdf of the syllabus of a programme and fill in the required data in the google sheet. To get access to the sheet mail me your email id @
  keshavandteam@gmail.com
  
  Here I have listed all the UG programmes offered by DU and their status. Please go through to get a picture of the progress of the project.

<h3> Prepare Webpage for a course: </h3>
  Code webpage for the courses whose data is available in the sheet. To get acess to that sheet mail me at above mentioned mail. Well you need to know HTML & CSS at
  the least if you wanna do this one.
  
<h3> Help in designing the webpage: </h3>
  I am good with coding but trust me I can be horrible when it comes to designing things so I am gonna need a hand in that. You need work on improvising the design
  of the webpage.
