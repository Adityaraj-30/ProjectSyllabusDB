# ProjectSyllabusDB

The Project aims to present syllabus of all the courses, offered Delhi University, in a more interactive manner than pdfs.

Whenever I move to next semester first thing I do is look at the syllabus and get familier with the course and the topics that will be covered. I believe by looking at the syllabus you get to know what to expect from the courses you are taking up and how to manage it with other ventures that you are on.

# What to do

I am gonna need couple of hands because this one's a big task, anyone who want to be a part of this project and contribute to it just hit me up on my mail @
keshavandteam@gmail.com and let me know which task you are taking up. You can also message me on discord (Id:- Professor#0785)

Following are the tasks that we need to do:

<h3> Collect data about the courses: </h3>

  Get the latest pdf of the syllabus of a programme and fill in the required data in the google sheet. To get access to the sheet mail me your email id @
  keshavandteam@gmail.com

<h3> Prepare Webpage for a course: </h3>
  Code webpage for the courses whose data is available in the sheet. To get acess to that sheet mail me at above mentioned mail. Well you need to know HTML & CSS at
  the least if you wanna do this one.
  
<h3> Help in designing the webpage: </h3>
  I am good with coding but trust me I can be horrible when it comes to designing things so I am gonna need a hand in that. You need work on improvising the design
  of the webpage.
  
# Sample Website
To get a glimpse of what the website would look like, clone the repository locally and go to bscHCS folder and open bscCS.html file. This is the webpage I designed
for BSc Hons. Computer Science course as per the latest syllabus (2019-2020).
